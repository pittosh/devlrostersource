The RosterSource Platform as a Service (PaaS) gives health systems and health insurers alike the freedom of keeping their data in their own line of business systems and still share it in near-real-time with their close partners or the broader ecosystem, including government entities. 


Significant cost savings are achieved through federated roster management shared services and open source software. Youâ€™re no longer alone.
